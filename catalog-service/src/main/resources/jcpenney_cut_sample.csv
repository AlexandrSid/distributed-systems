She told me to trust her and go to a D. After laughing for a very long time I agreed to try it. And WOW is all I can say.

The Full/Queen quilt is really too small. Please note that the bedspreads are the correct sizes--go with those instead of the quilts (plus they have a true queen size, not a full/queen). Had I picked up on the actual measurements, I would have ordered the bedspreads instead.

I liked the stripes and they do look very nice with my slate blue room and dark wood furniture. However, as other customers have indicated, they are very, very thin even though they are lined - the lining is also thin. I also bought 2 of the valences since the drapes hang on either side of a wide window. The valences are of a good weight. However, both the drapery panels and the valences were very uneven in length. I had to shorten the drapes anyway and add a thermal lining (I made it), so I made the drape panels even when shortened them and then I sewed the lining to the top of the back side of the panels. Because the valences were also very uneven, I had to take them apart and make them more even before I could join them together to make a very wide valance. I had planned to just join the 2 valences by lightly stitching them together. :-( Getting the panels and valence ready to hang turn-out to be a rather large project!!

They wash up nice and I did not notice that the had shrunk in the dryer on low heat. My husband says the neckline is not tight to his neck compared to another brand he tried and that means alot because he wears them everyday. So comfort is very important. I will be buying him more of these. BTW they are a nice soft material so another good insight to these thermals.""}, {""review_2""=>""The shirt was great- but it was too big.

Instructions say machine wash on cold, no chlorine bleach, and machine dry on delicate. The value was great because they were on sale.
